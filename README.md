# Baruch-Textbook

This is the public repository for our project: the Baruch Textbook Exchange Platform. 
We will be using Node.js and Express.js for our backend, mySQL for our database and the templating engine in Hogan.js

This will be treated as a real-world project, everyone is expected to contribute to it and we will deploy the platform once its finished. I hope you guys can use this as a starting point to jumpstart your career in software development.
